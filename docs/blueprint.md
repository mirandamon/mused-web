# **App Name**: BeatFlow

## Core Features:

- Fragment Creation: A 4x4 grid interface to create music fragments by adding sound effects to each square, with options for pre-recorded and live recorded sounds.
- Home Feed: Display a vertically scrollable home feed of music fragments, allowing users to like, comment, and view timestamps of comments.
- Remix Flow: Enable users to remix existing fragments using the 4x4 grid interface, starting with the original fragment's sounds; create shared fragments co-owned by the original author and remixer.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light gray for a clean, modern look.
- Secondary color: Dark navy blue for contrast and sophistication.
- Accent: Orange for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clean and modern font (e.g., Roboto or Open Sans) for readability across different screen sizes, embodying a minimalist aesthetic.
- Use minimalist icons for navigation and interactive elements, maintaining a clean and delightful UX (inspired by Airbnb and Brex).
- Grid-based layout for the fragment creation screen, ensuring a clear and structured interface.
- Incorporate subtle animations on key moments such as page transitions and element rendering (e.g., squares appearing in the 4x4 grid) to enhance the user experience.

## Original User Request:
I'd like to create a React Native mobile application for music creation and social media for beats called Mused. There are 3 main flows. One is the post creation flow where you post a musical fragment. The UI for that screen consists of a 4x4 grid of squares, where each square corresponds to a unit of a beat in a song. The inspiration for this screen is similar to the Ableton Push 3 (which is a MIDI controller with the same 4x4 grid of squares). On this screen, the user can add sound effects to the squares - and these sound effects could be prerecorded ones, or live recorded ones. After posting this fragment, the second flow is the home feed flow, where useres can browse through a vertically scrollable list of fragments (similar to the photo feed on the Instagram home page). They can like or comment on each fragment post, which will also include the timestamp for when they left their comment. The third and final flow is the remix flow, where someone can remix a fragment they see in their feed. The remix flow will bring up the 4x4 square grid used in the creation flow, but instead of starting with a blank grid, they start with a prepopulated grid of sounds from the original post. Posting from the remix flow will post a shared fragment, which is co-owned by the original author and the remixer (the user who pressed the remix button).

Before you proceed to create the app, please ask any clarifying questions that would help you understand what I'm asking for. Is there anything that's unclear that would make this a more beautiful and polished app?
